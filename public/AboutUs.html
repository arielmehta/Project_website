                            <p>Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District has given us the guidance and materials needed to get the project started. They have generously provided us with traps, and will aid in the process of identifying and analyzing the collected data. </p>

                        <p>Dr. Joyce Blueford, founder and president of Math Science Nucleus, has dedicated much of her life to science. As a geologist, she studied the evolution of sedimentary basins in the Pacific Ocean, California, Alaska, and Russia. In her time as a U.S. Geological Survey research scientist, Dr. Blueford became a strong proponent of involving more women and minorities in the ranks of geologists. She also became an advocate of strengthening science education, authoring 23 science books for children, as well as the Integrating Science, Math, and Technology Reference curriculum, which is used in school districts across the country. Dr. Blueford continues her efforts to foster a love for science in young people, involving students in research and educational projects.</p>
